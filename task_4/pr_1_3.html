    <h2>Mathematical formulas</h2>
    
    <h4>Linear Equations</h4>
    <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
    
    <p class="formula_p"><span class="formula_sp">ax + b = 0</span></p>
    
    <p>where <span class="perem">a</span> and <span class="perem">b</span> are real numbers and <span class="perem">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <span class="perem">x</span> so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <span class="perem">x</span> there.</p>
    
    <h4>Quadratic Equation</h4>
    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
    
    <p class="formula_p"><span class="formula_sp">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</span></p>
    
    <p>where <span class="perem">a</span>, <span class="perem">b</span>, <span class="perem">c</span> are known values and <span class="perem">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="perem">a</span> can't be 0.</p>
    
    <h4>The area of a circle (A)</h4>
    <p><span class="perem">&Pi;</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span class="perem">r</span>) squared:</p>
    
    <p class="formula_p"><span class="formula_sp">A = &Pi; &times; r<sup>2</sup></span></p>
    
    <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span class="perem">D</span>):</p>
    
    <p class="formula_p"><span class="formula_sp">A = (&Pi; / 4) &times; D<sup>2</sup></span></p>
    
    <p>or, when you know the circumference (<span class="perem">C</span>):</p>
    
    <p class="formula_p"><span class="formula_sp">A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &times; &pi;</span></p> 

    <h4>Intersection</h4>
    <p>The intersection of two sets <span class="perem">A</span> and <span class="perem">B</span>, denoted by A &cap; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>
    
    <p class="formula_p"><span class="formula_sp">A &cap; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B }</span></p>
    
    <p>That is, <span class="perem">x</span> is an element of the intersection A &cap; B if and only if <span class="perem">x</span> is both an element of <span class="perem">A</span> and an element of <span class="perem">B</span>.</p>
